To do this, we will employ some architectures, namely the CNN and Autoencoder, that you will see much more detail of in upcoming lectures. This lab introduces the concepts of both Autoencoders and CNNs. This lab remains agnostic of the specifics of how CNNs are implemented, we will spare this detail for a future lab.\n",

    "# Introduction to Auto-encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will create a **simple autoencoder** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Autoencoding\" is a data compression algorithm where the compression and decompression functions are 1) data-specific, 2) lossy, and 3) learned automatically from examples rather than engineered by a human. Additionally, in almost all contexts where the term \"autoencoder\" is used, the compression and decompression functions are implemented with neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1) Autoencoders are _data-specific_, which means that they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on. This is different from, say, the MPEG-2 Audio Layer III (MP3) compression algorithm, which only holds assumptions about \"sound\" in general, but not about specific types of sounds. An autoencoder trained on pictures of faces would do a rather poor job of compressing pictures of trees, because the features it would learn would be face-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Autoencoders are _lossy_, which means that the decompressed outputs will be degraded compared to the original inputs (similar to MP3 or JPEG compression). This differs from lossless arithmetic compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Autoencoders are _learned automatically from data examples_, which is a useful property: it means that it is easy to train specialized instances of the algorithm that will perform well on a specific type of input. It doesn't require any new engineering, just appropriate training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an autoencoder, you need three things: an encoding function, a decoding function, and a distance function between the amount of information loss between the compressed representation of your data and the decompressed representation (i.e. a \"loss\" function). The encoder and decoder will be chosen to be parametric functions (typically neural networks), and to be differentiable with respect to the distance function, so the parameters of the encoding/decoding functions can be optimize to minimize the reconstruction loss, using Stochastic Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a neural network is a computational model that is used for finding a function describing the relationship between data features $x$ and its values or labels $y$, i.e. $y = f(x)$.\n",
    "An autoencoder is specific type of neural network, which consists of encoder and decoder components: (1) the **encoder**, which learns a compressed data representation $z$, and (2) the **decoder**, which reconstructs the data $\\hat{x}$ based on its idea $z$ of how it is structured:\n",
    "$$ z = f\\big(h_{e}(x)\\big)$$\n",
    "$$ \\hat{x} = f\\big(h_{d}(z)\\big),$$\n",
    "where $z$ is the learned data representation by encoder $h_{e}$, and $\\hat{x}$ is the reconstructed data by decoder $h_{d}$ based on $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder and decoder are defined as:\n",
    "$$ z = f\\big(h_{e}(x)\\big)$$\n",
    "$$ \\hat{x} = f\\big(h_{d}(z)\\big),$$\n",
    "where $z$ is the compressed data representation generated by encoder $h_{e}$, and $\\hat{x}$ is the reconstructed data generated by decoder $h_{d}$ based on $z$.\n",

    "<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/benjaminirving/mlseminars-autoencoders/blob/master/imgs/d1.png?raw=1\" width=\"80%\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this figure, we take as input an image, and compress that image before decompressing it using a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many resources that explain the operation of Autoencoders online. Particularly interesing is https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/Bonus_Autoencoders/student/Bonus_Tutorial1.html, which provides an excellent example of an Autoencoder for a similar use case, as well as an interesting comparison of deep encoders to PCA decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key uses of deep autoencoders are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data compression\n",
    "2. Denoising\n",
    "3. Anomaly Detection\n",

    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Nets provide a basic architecture that preserves inputs as 2D images. Instead of maintaining a *weight matrix*, it maintaines a set of (usually square) *filters* (also known as *kernels*), which are smaller than the size of the input image.\n",

The function we use for this is the Transpose Convolution. This takes a single pixel from the input map, and multiplies it by a kernel/filter. These maps are then combined to form an enlarged output map.\n",
